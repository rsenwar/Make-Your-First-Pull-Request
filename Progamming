** AppleScript ** is a scripting language created by Apple Inc. that facilitates automated control over scriptable Mac applications. First introduced in System 7, it is currently included in all versions of macOS as part of a package of system automation tools. The term "AppleScript" may refer to the language itself, to an individual script written in the language, or, informally, to the macOS Open Scripting Architecture that underlies the language.
An ** assembly language ** , often abbreviated ** asm **, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
** ActionScript ** is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc.. It is a derivation of HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now a dialect of ECMAScript, though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk.
